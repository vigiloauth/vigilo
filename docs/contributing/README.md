## 2 Commit Standards

We follow the **_Conventional Commit_** standards to ensure clear and meaningful commit messages. Use the format:
```azure
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

### 2.1 Commit Types

- `breaking`: Introduce a breaking change that may require users to modify their code or dependencies.
- `feat`: Add a new feature that enhances the functionality of the project.
- `fix`: Apply a bug fix that resolves an issue without affecting functionality.
- `task`: Add or modify internal functionality that supports the codebase but doesn't introduce a new feature or fix a bug (e.g., utility methods, service logic, or internal improvements).
- `chore`: Miscellaneous or updates that aren't features or fixes (e.g., updating build tools, dependencies, or configuration files).
- `docs`: Modify documentation, such as fixing typos or adding new content.
- `style`: Apply code style or formatting changes that do not affect behavior.
- `refactor`: Restructure existing code without changing its external behavior.
- `test`: Add or modify tests without affecting functionality.


### 2.2 Manual Testing

To facilitate the process of manually testing changes, we provide a script to push a Docker container for manual testing purposes. To run the script, navigate to the `scripts` directory from your terminal and simply run:
```bash
./push_docker_dev.sh
```
