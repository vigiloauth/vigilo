## 1. Add VigiloAuth to Your Project

To add **VigiloAuth** to your project, simply create a `yaml` configuration file, and your desired configuration settings.

---

## 2. Import the Library

In your `docker-compose.yaml` file, add **VigiloAuth** as a service:

```yaml
services:
    vigilo-auth:
        image: vigiloauth/server:latest
        container_name: vigilo-auth
        ports:
         - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
         # Mount your YAML configuration file into the container
         - ./<path to your yaml config>:/app/vigilo.yaml

         # Mount your cert and key files into the container.
         # Note: Only use when HTTPS is enabled.
         - ./<path to cert file>:/app/server.cert
         - ./<path to key file>:/app/server.key
        environment:
          # Tell the container where to find the YAML config
          VIGILO_CONFIG_PATH: /app/vigilo.yaml

          # --- REQUIRED SECRETS (Provided via Environment Variables) ---
          # The following secrets MUST be provided as environment variables.
          # Do NOT put these sensitive values directly in this docker-compose.yaml file.
          # Define them in a .env file next to this docker-compose.yaml, or in your shell environment.
          SMTP_USERNAME: ${SMTP_USERNAME}
          SMTP_PASSWORD: ${SMTP_PASSWORD}
          SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS: ${SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS}
          TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY: ${TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY} # Base64 encoded RSA private key
          TOKEN_PUBLIC_KEY: ${TOKEN_PUBLIC_KEY} # Base64 encoded RSA public key
          TOKEN_ISSUER: ${TOKEN_ISSUER}
```

## 2.1 Providing Required Secrets and Configuration

**VigiloAuth** requires configuration to run correctly. For security, sensitive information (secrets) are not included in the Docker image or the main YAML configuration file. These secrets must be provided to the container at runtime via environment variables.

Other non-sensitive configuration (like ports, timeouts, password policies) can be provided through the YAML configuration file mounted into the container.

#### 2.1.1 Required Environment Variables (Secrets):

You must provide the following environment variables when running the VigiloAuth container. The application uses these for sensitive operations like sending emails and signing tokens.

- `SMTP_USERNAME`: Username for connecting to the SMTP server. (optional)
- `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`: The 'From' email address for outgoing emails. (optional)
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Password for the SMTP server. (optional)
- `TOKEN_ISSUER`: The issuer identifier for JWT tokens (e.g., your service URL).
- `TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your RSA private key used for signing tokens, encoded in Base64.
- `TOKEN_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your RSA public key used for verifying tokens, encoded in Base64.


#### 2.1.2 How to Provide Environment Variables:

When using docker-compose, the simplest and recommended way to provide these secrets without putting them directly in the docker-compose.yaml file is to create a .env file in the same directory as your docker-compose.yaml file. Docker Compose will automatically read variables from this file.

```
# .env file (place next to your docker-compose.yaml)
SMTP_USERNAME=your_smtp_user
SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=auth@yourdomain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password_here
TOKEN_ISSUER=auth.yourdomain.com
TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY=base64_encoded_private_key_string_here
TOKEN_PUBLIC_KEY=base64_encoded_public_key_string_here
```

## 3. Basic Setup Example

Hereâ€™s a minimal example of how to integrate **VigiloAuth** into your application:

```yaml
log_level: debug # default log level is INFO

server_config:
  port: 8080
  session_cookie_name: test-session-cookie
  domain: auth.example.com
  force_https: true
  read_timeout: 30 # in seconds
  write_timeout: 30 # in seconds
  authorization_code_duration: 30 # in minutes
  enable_request_logging: true # boolean value (true or false)
```

After adding the configuration file to your `docker-compose.yaml` file, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
docker-compose up
```

### 3.1 Configuring The Server
Here is an example on how to configure the server to suit your needs. To learn more about the configuration options, refer to the [configuration guide](./configuration_guide.md)

```yaml
log_level: debug

server_config:
  port: 8080
  session_cookie_name: test-session-cookie
  domain: auth.example.com
  force_https: true
  read_timeout: 30
  write_timeout: 30
  authorization_code_duration: 30
  enable_request_logging: true
  cert_file_path: /app/path/to/cert
  key_file_path: /app/path/to/key
```

---

### 3.2 Token Configuration
Here is an example on how to configure the token requirements to suit your needs. To learn more about the configuration options, refer to the [configuration guide](./configuration_guide.md)

```yaml
token_config:
  expiration_time: 30 # in minutes
  access_token_duration: 30 # in minutes
  refresh_token_duration: 2 # in days
```

---

### 3.3 Login Configuration
Here is an example on how to configure the login functionality to suit your needs. To learn more about the configuration options, refer to the [configuration guide](./configuration_guide.md)
