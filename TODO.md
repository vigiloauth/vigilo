- [x] Return a `401 Unauthorized` if the client does not exist, and revoke the `registration_access_token`
- [x] Integration test
- [x] DOCS

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Client Update Endpoint â†’ `PUT /register/{client_id}`
- [x] **Protected Route**: Requires `registration_access_token`
- [x] Create a route `PUT /register/{client_id}`
- [x] Extract `client_id` from the request URL
- [x] Validate the **registration access token** (ensures only the client itself can modify its data)
- [x] Parse and validate the request body
- [x] Ensure `client_id` and `client_secret` **cannot be modified**
- [x] Update allowed fields (`client_name`, `redirect_uris`, `grant_types`, etc.)
- [x] Save updated client data to the database
- [x] Return the updated client metadata
- [x] The request must include JSON containing `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uris`, `grant_types`, and can include any other metadata.
- [x] Returns `200 OK` if successful.
- [x] Return an error as described in [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750) for an invalid `registration_access_token`
- [x] Return a `401 Unauthorized` if the client does not exist, and revoke the `registration_access_token`
- [x] Ensure response format follows [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html#section-3) 
- [x] Return a `403 Forbidden` if the client is not allowed to update its records.
- [x] Integration test
- [x] DOCS

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Client Delete Endpoint â†’ `DELETE /register/{client_id}`
- [ ] **Protected Route**: Requires `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Create a route `DELETE /register/{client_id}`
- [ ] Extract `client_id` from the request URL
- [ ] Validate the **registration access token** (ensures only the client itself can delete its data)
- [ ] Delete the client record from the database
- [ ] Invalidate the `client_id`
- [ ] Invalidate the `client_secret`
- [ ] Invalidate the `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Return `204 No Content` on success
- [ ] Integration test
- [ ] DOCS

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Registration Access Token Handling
- [ ] Generate a **secure** `registration_access_token` on client creation
- [ ] Store the token securely in the database with the client record
- [ ] Require the token for `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
- [ ] Validate the token on incoming requests
- [ ] Implement proper token expiration or revocation mechanisms
- [ ] Return an error as described in [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750) for an invalid `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Return a `403 Forbidden` error if the client cannot delete itself.
- [ ] If the client does not exist, respond with `401 Unauthorized` and revoke the token immediately.
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Docs
