## ðŸ”¹ 4. Client Delete Endpoint â†’ `DELETE /register/{client_id}`
- [x] **Protected Route**: Requires `registration_access_token`
- [x] Create a route `DELETE /register/{client_id}`
- [x] Extract `client_id` from the request URL
- [x] Validate the **registration access token** (ensures only the client itself can delete its data)

- [x] Invalidate the `client_id`
- [x] Invalidate the `client_secret`
- [x] Invalidate the `registration_access_token`
- [x] Return `204 No Content` on success

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Registration Access Token Handling
- [x] Generate a **secure** `registration_access_token` on client creation
- [x] Store the token securely in the database with the client record
- [x] Require the token for `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
- [x] Validate the token on incoming requests
- [x] Implement proper token expiration or revocation mechanisms
- [x] Return an error as described in [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750) for an invalid `registration_access_token`
- [x] Return a `403 Forbidden` error if the client cannot delete itself.
- [x] If the client does not exist, respond with `401 Unauthorized` and revoke the token immediately.
