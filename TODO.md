## ðŸ”¹1. Update Client Registration
- [ ] Include a `registration_access_token` in the response 
- [ ] Store token in the database
- [ ] Ensure the token has an expiratoin time.
- [ ] Construct the `client_configuration_endpoint`: `BASE_URL + /registre/{client_id}`
- [ ] Include the token, and the endpoint in the response.
- [ ] Ensure response format follows [RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)
- [ ] Include `client_id_issued_at` in the response.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Client Read Endpoint (Self-Access) â†’ `GET /register/{client_id}`
- [ ] **Protected Route**: Requires `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Create a route `GET /register/{client_id}`
- [ ] Extract `client_id` from the request URL
- [ ] Validate the **registration access token** (ensures only the client itself can access its details)
- [ ] Fetch client details from the database
- [ ] Exclude sensitive fields (e.g., `client_secret`)
- [ ] Return client metadata in JSON format
- [ ] Ensure response format follows [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html#section-3) 
- [ ] Returns `200 OK` if successful.
- [ ] Return an error as described in [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750) for an invalid `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Return a `401 Unauthorized` if the client does not exist, and revoke the `registration_access_token`

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Client Update Endpoint â†’ `PUT /register/{client_id}`
- [ ] **Protected Route**: Requires `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Create a route `PUT /register/{client_id}`
- [ ] Extract `client_id` from the request URL
- [ ] Validate the **registration access token** (ensures only the client itself can modify its data)
- [ ] Parse and validate the request body
- [ ] Ensure `client_id` and `client_secret` **cannot be modified**
- [ ] Update allowed fields (`client_name`, `redirect_uris`, `grant_types`, etc.)
- [ ] Save updated client data to the database
- [ ] Return the updated client metadata
- [ ] The request must include JSON containing `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uris`, `grant_types`, and can include any other metadata.
- [ ] Returns `200 OK` if successful.
- [ ] Return an error as described in [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750) for an invalid `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Return a `401 Unauthorized` if the client does not exist, and revoke the `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Ensure response format follows [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html#section-3) 
- [ ] Return a `403 Forbidden` if the client is not allowed to update its records.
---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Client Delete Endpoint â†’ `DELETE /register/{client_id}`
- [ ] **Protected Route**: Requires `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Create a route `DELETE /register/{client_id}`
- [ ] Extract `client_id` from the request URL
- [ ] Validate the **registration access token** (ensures only the client itself can delete its data)
- [ ] Delete the client record from the database
- [ ] Invalidate the `client_id`
- [ ] Invalidate the `client_secret`
- [ ] Invalidate the `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Return `204 No Content` on success

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Registration Access Token Handling
- [ ] Generate a **secure** `registration_access_token` on client creation
- [ ] Store the token securely in the database with the client record
- [ ] Require the token for `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
- [ ] Validate the token on incoming requests
- [ ] Implement proper token expiration or revocation mechanisms
- [ ] Return an error as described in [RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750) for an invalid `registration_access_token`
- [ ] Return a `403 Forbidden` error if the client cannot delete itself.
- [ ] If the client does not exist, respond with `401 Unauthorized` and revoke the token immediately.
---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Ensure **OAuth scopes** are properly handled for client management (`client:admin` for admins)
- [ ] Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- [ ] Log access attempts and updates for auditing
- [ ] Use **secure hashing** for storing client secrets
